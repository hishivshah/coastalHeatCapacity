# Heat Capacity of Coastal Waters

Water source heat pumps have the potential to provide renewable energy to buildings and settlements located near water bodies. Building on a previous assessment of Welsh rivers, an assessment of coastal waters around Wales has also been carried out, to help identify suitable locations for deploying heat pump technology in coastal waters.
